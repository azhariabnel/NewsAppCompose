This is a simple News app using https://newsapi.org/ API. i made this with Compose for UI, Retrofit for json parser, Coroutine for Async API, Dagger for dependency Injection and also MVVM with clean architecture.
I also used some of 3rd party libraries like material(icon & typograph),navigation,coil and accompanist. I'm really sorry for the simple UI, the points are knowdledge sharing in this app. feel free to read the code.

<div align="start">
    <img src="splash screen.png" width="400px"</img> 
</div>
Simple splash screen using material asset in android studio.

<div align="start">
    <img src="home screen.png" width="400px"</img> 
</div>
Simple home screen for bring up the news list, im using material asset as a placeholder for the news image.

<div align="start">
    <img src="home screen 2.png" width="400px"</img> 
</div>
It also had swipe refresh for reload current list.

<div align="start">
    <img src="detail screen.png" width="400px"</img> 
</div>
Details for the selected news. this API doesnt much provide data for personal use, but i think this is enough.
